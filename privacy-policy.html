                                during transmission and upon receipt. No method of transmission or

                            <p>
                                Our system is built to store and process data within or as close to
                                your location as possible. We have set up multiple variants of our
                                system to ensure this is the case. Using cloud services allows us to
                                provide our services in multiple geographical locations to ensure
                                that your data stays within a set geographical range. For example,
                                for customers located in Europe, we have set up our system
                                infrastructure within European boundaries and all services run
                                through this separated infrastructure.<br />On occasion, we may need
                                to transfer your personal information to locations outside the
                                jurisdiction in which we provide our for the purposes set out in
                                this privacy policy. This may entail a transfer of your information
                                from a location within the European Economic Area (the “EEA”) to
                                outside the EEA, or from outside the EEA to a location within the
                                EEA. Please see ‘How we share information’ for more detail on how
                                the information may be shared with HealthTrack SG offices and third
                                party service providers.<br />The level of information protection in
                                countries outside the EEA may be less than that offered within the
                                EEA. Where this is the case, we will implement appropriate measures
                                to ensure that your personal information remains protected and
                                secure in accordance with applicable data protection laws. Where our
                                third party service providers process personal data outside the EEA
                                in the course of providing services to us, our written agreement
                                with them will include appropriate measures, usually standard
                                contractual clauses.

                                use our Services. Please note that the countries where we operate
                                may have privacy and data protection laws that differ from, and are
                                potentially less protective than, the laws of your country. You
                                agree to this risk when you have an account with us and agree to our
                                Terms and Conditions, irrespective of which country you live in. If
                                you later wish to withdraw your consent, you can terminate your

                                right in accordance with applicable data protection law to have it

                                information, to stop unauthorised transfers of your personal
                                information to a third party and, in some circumstances, to have
                                personal information relating to you transferred to another
                                organisation.<br />You may also have the right to lodge a complaint

                                information with a local supervisory authority.<br />The right to
                                object to processing – If you object to the processing of your

                                choice in accordance with our legal obligations.<br />Your objection
                                (or withdrawal of any previously given consent) could mean that we
                                are unable to perform the actions necessary to achieve the purposes
                                set out above (see ‘How we use information’) or that you may not be
                                able to make use of the Services and Products offered by us. Please
                                note that even after you have chosen to withdraw your consent we may
                                be able to continue to process your personal information to the
                                extent required or otherwise permitted by law, in particular in
